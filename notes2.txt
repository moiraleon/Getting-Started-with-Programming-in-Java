Java Syntax

made of statements, all must end in a semicolon ;
Whitespace does not affect the statements behavior;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments

java supports line comments (//), which ignored everything until the end of a line or reaches a new line character;
java supports block comments(/*....*/) continues to ignore everything contained within the /*...*/ can be a clip of a line or multiple lines, cannot be nested within eachother because the new */ will be identified as the endpoint and the /* with be ignored within the block comment and there will be one without a pair;
java supports javadoc comments (/**...*/) to the complier it is the same as the block comment, can be used to generate documentation, write documentation for our code directly in the source code;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Packages
we normally qualify our source files with a package name, they are for organization;

Syntax
all lowercase
reverse domain name notation To assure global uniqueness

i.e.

package com.pluralsight.example;

||.sales
||.sales.management
||.marketing
||.marketing.ohio
||.management.ohio

etc
//code below

in code example--

package com.pluralsight.example;
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	System.out.println("First line from app");
	System.out.println("Second line from app");
	System.out.println("Third line from app");
    }
}

organizations source would be package com.pluralsight.example.main
first folder accessed will be the src folder and then so on

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables - strongly typed

data types must be declared 

multiple variable can be set at the same time if same type
    i.e. int a=2,b=10,c=30;

i.e. 
int dataValue;
dataValue = 100;

or

int myInfo = 200;

variable names can not begin with a number or contain special characters aside from numbers and letters(no _ or 4me) use camelCase;
variables can be set to other variables and made equal;
variables can be set as constants in java with the word final;

final int maxStudents = 25;

Primitive Data Types
integers - byte(8bits[-128,127]) short(16bits[-32768,32767]) int(32bits[-2bill,2bill]) long(64bits[really big numbers] written with L as eend of number i.e. 47759538958838595898558989358538595395358598L)
floating - float(store decimal, values 32 bits, need to write 'f' after value i.e. 437587.988f) double(64 bits indicate with 'd' after value i.e. 47.69869999999d)
character - stores unicode characters with \u followed by hex code that aren't on the keyboard i.e. '\u00DA'; //accented U, literal values between single quotes 'U',
boolean- true/false

each variables values are unrelated, when assigning One variable to another variable it copies that current variables value, as the second variable changes the first value does not because they are independent

 arithmetic Operators
 Basic â€“ produce a result, no impact and values used in the operation(+-*/%);
 Prefix/postfix - increase or decrease the value, replace original value(++,--) if operator is before the variable you get the result of that operation and the initial var is changed because it has been performed on, when the operator is after the variable you will get back the value prior to the operation but the initial vlaue was not performed on i.e ++5 = 5, 5 5++ = 5, 6; 
 Compound assignment - operate on a value, replace original value -=, +=,;

PEMDAS order 
Postix, Prefix, Multiplicative, Additive
everything operates left to right
parenthasis take precedence

cast operators can modify a data type

long var = 10;
short var = (short) 9;

conversion completed
parenthasis portion called a cast
Conversion can have side effects

nariowing (i.e.long->short) cuts out extra bits to make fit
floating-> to integer fractional portion is discarder
integer -> to floating precision lost

implicit conversion -widening, automatic;
explicit conversion -use cast, we state what type of conversion;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Relational Operators
 
>,>=,<,<=, ==,!=
    'c'>'a' will result in true bc uniode points are being compared in length

EX:
int value1 =7;
int value2 =6;
int maxValue = value1 > value2 ? value1 : value2
Displays
value1 if true
value2 if false


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IF statement 
an if statement only runs the one line of code that follows

if(value1 > value2)
    System.out.println("value 1 is bigger than value 2");
else 
    System.out.println("value 1 is not bigger than value 2");

ELSE IF statements

if(condition-1)
    true-statement-1;
else if (condition-2)
    true-statement-2;
    .
    .
    .
else if (condition-n)
    true-statement-n;
else 
    false-statement;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logical Operators (STANDARD)

& - and two true results;
| - OR if one both sides result to true true|true, false|true, true|false;
^ - exclusive or (XOR), if one side or other is true, but not both;
! - negation, reverses the value, i.e. only a false end result with result in true;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conditional Logical Operators (CONDITIONAL)
only do enough work needed to determine the result
only perform the right side of the operation when needed, if they get the result they need they will stop and return the value;

&& - and, only runs right side if left side has shown to be true;
|| - or, executtes right side only when left side is false;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Block Statements
copile multiple lines of code with curly braces just as in all ther languages {};

determines scope of variables;
if (condition){

}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switch Statement

run through and switch current value that applies with correct case statement and runs until break indicator that tells the code to jump out of th eswitch statement;

only supports following primitive types: int (byte, int,short,long) and char data types;

need break statements to help code to stop runnign once designated code has operated, else it will "fall through" -> run through all of the code;
indicate by using switch() with variable you want to work on within the parenthasis;

at end of switch statment we dont use else, we use default;
