Java Syntax

made of statements, all must end in a semicolon ;
Whitespace does not affect the statements behavior;


Comments

java supports line comments (//), which ignored everything until the end of a line or reaches a new line character;
java supports block comments(/*....*/) continues to ignore everything contained within the /*...*/ can be a clip of a line or multiple lines, cannot be nested within eachother because the new */ will be identified as the endpoint and the /* with be ignored within the block comment and there will be one without a pair;
java supports javadoc comments (/**...*/) to the complier it is the same as the block comment, can be used to generate documentation, write documentation for our code directly in the source code;

Packages
we normally qualify our source files with a package name, they are for organization;

Syntax
all lowercase
reverse domain name notation To assure global uniqueness

i.e.

package com.pluralsight.example;

||.sales
||.sales.management
||.marketing
||.marketing.ohio
||.management.ohio

etc
//code below

in code example--

package com.pluralsight.example;
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	System.out.println("First line from app");
	System.out.println("Second line from app");
	System.out.println("Third line from app");
    }
}

organizations source would be package com.pluralsight.example.main
first folder accessed will be the src folder and then so on
